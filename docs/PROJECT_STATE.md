# Project State

## Current Milestone

M1 — Script Quality & Narrative Contract

## Current Status

M0 Product Foundation complete.
M1 ready for planning.
M1 execution uses evidence-driven vertical iteration.
M1 empirical benchmark fixture established.
Application implementation has not started.

Golden Story v0 selected: Otonari no Tenshi-sama Japanese Web Novel Chapter 1.
Tracked sample corpus available for Chapters 1–5.
RUN_0001_BASELINE_A executed using Chapter 1 only.
First real Vietnamese storytelling script produced.
Project Owner human review pending.
RUN_0001 Baseline A received preliminary Orchestrator failure analysis.
Baseline showed generally adequate event comprehension but weak creator-oriented narrative transformation.
Human / Project Owner qualitative review remains pending.
No advanced retrieval/memory architecture is justified by this single-chapter run.

H1 stronger narrative instructions formally evaluated.
Prompt V2 improved narrative transformation, pacing, and spoken style, while factual/interpretive drift and output-language corruption remained.
H1 verdict: PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED.
Project Owner A/B preference remains pending.

H2 Separate Story Brief experiment executed as RUN_0003.
RUN_0003 introduces a minimal factual Story Brief between source understanding and narrative generation.
H2 verdict: PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED. Story Brief showed factual utility, but Writer adherence remains a problem.
Project Owner preference pending.

H6 Factual Script Critic formally evaluated.
H6 verdict: PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED.
Critic detected genuine Writer deviations but coverage remained incomplete.
Critic-guided revision achieved the recorded output length of 1074 words from 1648 and corrected
some flagged drift, while some unsupported or stronger-than-Brief claims remained.
Project Owner preference remains pending.

- LLM selection per pipeline stage
- Model Router / orchestration strategy
- Evaluation benchmark details
- Human-vs-automation workflow policy

## Current Quality Gate

M0 Foundation Gate: PASSED

Script Quality Gate: NOT YET EVALUATED

RUN_0007 executed the first real deterministic full-coverage H6b semantic Critic attempt using Gemini 3.1 Pro High in a fresh Antigravity conversation.
32 deterministic review units expected.
mechanical coverage PASS.
raw YAML parse PASS.
schema conformance FAIL (violations preserved).

## Hypothesis Status

- H6b (Claim-Level Factual Critic vs Baseline Critic): SUPPORTED — on the frozen RUN3 controlled instance,
deterministic claim-level auditing substantially improved useful detection
coverage over Critic V1, but remained incomplete (11/33 robust issues detected).

## Current Task

RUN10 H7_EIC_V2 Stage A rerun passed strict mechanical validation against the
frozen V2 contract. The V2 format-hardening objective succeeded mechanically
on this developmental rerun. No gold scoring has been performed for RUN10.

Record:

V2 semantic attempts: 1

quality_based_regenerations: 0

H7 confirmatory verdict:

NOT_EVALUATED

Stage B:

NOT_AUTHORIZED

Historical note:

RUN8 remains invalid synthetic evidence.

RUN9 remains the preserved V1 developmental run with its Markdown-wrapper
format violation.

## Next Candidate

M1 — Freeze a gold-blind Stage A V2 union/dedup using the unchanged RUN7
baseline and mechanically valid RUN10 targeted-pass output before any gold
mapping.
